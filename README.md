# Ridge-and-Lasso

### In this exercise, we practice on regularization.
    
### The task is to create ridge and lasso regression and to perform cross-validation for choosing a tuning parameteter on the 'Hitters' dataset.
### After that, make predictions and evaluate the performance of the models.
#### Ridge and lasso regressions are machine learning algorithms with an integrated regularization functionality.
#### Built upon the essentials of linear regression with an additional penalty term, they serve as a calibrating tool for preventing overfitting.
